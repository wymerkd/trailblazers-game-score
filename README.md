# _Trailblazers Game Scores_

#### By Kyle Wymer**_

## Description

#### _This is an application was made as a POC for the Portland Trailblazers pre-game, live game, and post-game score game score views. It acts as the skeleton for said views, and can easily be plugged in to a backend. Currently it pulls in data from the test_json_object.js, which are being past to each component via props_

### Things that will need to change once connected to backend 

* _Set conditional rendering to switch between PreGame, LiveGame, and PostGame views depening on time in regards to specific game_

* _Switch out hard coded data in jsx files to display data using props (currently linked to dummy JSON object titled test_json_object.js)

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _$ git clone https://github.com/wymerkd/trailblazers-game-score.git_

* _$ cd trailblazers-game-score_

* _$ npm install_
